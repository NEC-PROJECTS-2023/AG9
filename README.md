Introduction of the project:
           This project explains the working of an Uber dataset, which contains data produced by Uber for New York City. Uber is defined as a P2P platform. The platform links you to drivers who can take you to your destination. The dataset includes primary data on Uber pickups with details including the date, time of the ride as well as longitude-latitude information, Using the information, the paper explains the use of the k-means clustering algorithm on the set of data and classify the various parts of New York City. Since the industry is booming and expected to grow shortly. Effective taxi dispatching will facilitate each driver and passenger to reduce the wait time to seek out one another. The model is employed to predict the demand on points of the city.
